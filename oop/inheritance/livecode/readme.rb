# Define a Pokemon with an initialize(name) constructor, exposing its name.

# Define four other classes: WaterPokemon, FirePokemon, GrassPokemon, ElectricPokemon classes

# Implement a #move instance method which returns a sentence like "Squirtle uses Water Gun" for each pokemon.

# In another Ruby file, create an array with Pikachu, Squirtle, Charmander & Bulbasaur, iterate over it and puts the move each pokemon make

# Implement a ::starter_types class method which will return an array of the three types of pokemon starters.

# Add a #hit_by(move) instance method in Pokemon which returns a sentence like “Squirtle was hit by Charm”. Then override this method for the ElectricClass class, and return a sentence like “Pikachu was hit by Charm. It was super effective!”
